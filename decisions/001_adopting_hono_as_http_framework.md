**Title:** Adopting Hono JS as the HTTP Framework

**Summary:**

This document outlines the decision to use Hono JS as the HTTP framework for the project.

**Description:**

The project required a lightweight, high-performance, and flexible HTTP framework to handle incoming requests and generate responses. After careful evaluation, Hono JS emerged as the most suitable choice due to its following advantages:

* **Minimalist and Efficient:** Hono JS is designed to be lean and efficient, focusing on providing the core features needed for building HTTP applications without unnecessary overhead.
* **Flexibility and Customization:** Hono JS offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing developers to customize and extend its functionality to suit their specific needs.
* **Modern JavaScript Features:** Hono JS leverages modern JavaScript features like async/await and promises, making it easy to write clean and asynchronous code.
* **Wide Compatibility:** Hono JS can run in most modern JavaScript runtimes, including Node.js, Deno, and Edge runtimes, providing flexibility in deployment options. It uses standard Fetch Request and Response objects, which guarantees ample documentation and integration possibilities.
* **Active Community and Support:** Hono JS has a growing community and active development, ensuring ongoing support and updates.

**Alternatives Considered:**

* **Express.js:** A popular choice, but considered to be more somewhat stale and less focused on modern JavaScript features.
* **Fastify:** Known for its performance, this would have been a solid choice. The reason Hono was chosen over Fastify is that Fastify runs only in Node JS while Hono supports multiple runtimes. Recent trends suggest that the server-side JS ecosystem is changing rapidly and other runtimes can be beneficial. For starters, in the short term, we might decide that Deno is a better foundation.
* **H3:** Very similar to Hono, it lacks documentation therefore while very capable the initial attempt to use it was a tad frustrating.

**Impact:**

Adopting Hono JS is expected to:

* Improve application performance due to its lightweight nature and efficient handling of requests.
* Enhance developer productivity by providing a clean and modern API.
* Increase flexibility and customization options for the project.
* Offer a wider range of deployment options thanks to its compatibility with various JavaScript runtimes.
